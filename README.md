# node-oracledb-on-m1-mac
Testing to see if I can  create a React app that can connect to my university's Oracle database on my M1 Mac. Currently, this is working on my Windows machine but not on my M1 Mac. Instructions for using Rosetta were found here, https://gist.github.com/LeZuse/bf838718ff2689c5fc035c5a6825a11c.
